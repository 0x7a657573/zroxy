**zroxy is a simple TLS sni proxy (sniproxy) written with pure C and no dependensi.**

This program supports incoming HTTP/HTTPS/IMAPs/POP3s/SMTPs â€¦ traffic and upstream to DIRECT/SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy.

  
### What is SNI?
*Server Name Indication* (**SNI**) is an extension to the Transport Layer Security (**TLS**) computer networking protocol by which a client indicates which hostname it is attempting to connect to at the start of the handshaking process.

This allows a server to present one of multiple possible certificates on the same IP address and TCP port number and hence allows multiple secure (HTTPS) websites (or any other service over TLS) to be served by the same IP address without requiring all those sites to use the same certificate.

It is the conceptual equivalent to HTTP/1.1 name-based virtual hosting, but for HTTPS.

**This** also allows a proxy to forward client traffic to the right server during TLS/SSL handshake. The desired hostname is not encrypted in the original SNI extension, so an eavesdropper can see which site is being requested.

### How Does it Work?
This project implements a transparent proxy that accepts TLS connection, parses the initial client greeting and proxies the complete SSL session to the backend corresponding to the server's name (or default backend if no SNI specified). This proxy **does NOT** require any cryptographic materials such private keys, public keys, certificates. It does not modify TLS session and does not perform man-in-the middle intrusion. Moreover, it is not even linked with any cryptographic library.

When connecting to a domain through TLS/HTTPS the initial TCP session contain the domain name **un-encrypted** and thus sniproxy can redirect a TLS connection based on that initial negotiation without decrypting the traffic nor needing a private key. this technique require a custom DNS Server that redirect the targeted domains to our zroxy server (dns server like Unbound, Bind or PowerDNS).
